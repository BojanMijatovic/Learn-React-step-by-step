-   Level 1
Having a website is a great way to showcase a product with the
ability to provide as many details as possible.
Create a new website that highlights the great features of the
product and provides in-depth information about each
feature. The pages should include:
• Homepage with photograph and high level overview
• Feature pages linked from homepage with more details

-   Level 2
Just because you made a website, doesn’t automatically mean
people will purchase the product.
Create a landing page as part of the marketing website that
drives people to sign up with a form for more information.

-   Level 3
Ultimately people need to purchase or sign up for the product
and to do that, they need a way to contact the sales team.
Create a new page with a form that will allow people to
contact the company if interested in the product. Include a
“Call to Action” link at the bottom of every page on the website
except for the contact page itself that links to the contact page.
